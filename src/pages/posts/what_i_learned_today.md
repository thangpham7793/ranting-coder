- `git bisect` (start, end, good, bad, etc., reset). Was actually doing it manually using `git checkout <commit>`, truly necessity is the mother of invention.

- Saw old colleagues and probably pissed off my old boss. I should not feel bad about it at all. The guy has an aura of an overbearing father trying to command respect and whom you don't want to prick. Red flag in my book.

- Spent few hours on what ends up to be a more or less useless chase. Always stops to ask is this possible first. If yes, has anyone done it for me?

- Leaking abstraction is not worth it. Changes not covered by automatic tests need to be so manually...

- Feel more and more jaded with frameworks. Getting senior? Haha. Maybe a bit of seniority is to grow tired of moving targets.

- 29 year-old? Nothing is new under the sun.
