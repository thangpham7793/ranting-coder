To prepare for a new job, I've been looking around PostgreSQL lately, more or less reading through some sort of religious war over where business logics should live. As you can imagine there are die-hards across the spectrum. Again, it all depends.

I did land on a sensible and well-argued answer [here](https://martinfowler.com/articles/dblogic.html), though of course it's still tinted by the author's personal experience and bias.

The mantra is basically avoid generalisation and let the use case and your team's social & personal preferences drive your decisions.

And it seems to be the conclusion of countless other debates, on topics not just limited to software.

> Why do we love generalisations so much?

Before you read on, mind that whatever follows is just wherever my train of thoughts takes me. There is no map of proof or evidences. My journey pieces together random bits from different domains, and probably sounds ridiculous at the end.

But anyhow, I think it's just very resource-efficent. Critical thinking, or whatever mental exercises demanded by sensible decisions come at a cost. I mean, try thinking about every single thing, from all the relevant angles, and you'll get a headache in no time.

We rely on heuristics, trained skills, and sometimes pure instincts or intuitions to get by. Our experiences only help to reinforce most of them. Of course people generalise, and live by them. Mental enegry is a precious resource.

So in a way seniors are paid much much more because they need to do the hard thinking for whatever business they work for.

> What's with the blank page?

A bit random, I admit. This is my first blog post, so here I am again facing the agony of countless writers before me.

There's also no moral to be gleaned from here. I don't know. If you blackmail me for one, I'd probably say think about what your boss achieves if you make those hard decisions for them, and do it well.

Not wanting to stray into the territory of the meaning of life here, it's tempting though. But yes, it's hard to be a tabula rasa these days. Everyone comes with their own baggage. And the seniors tend to have the heaviest of them.

That's a witty bit of nugget. So I'll end it here.
